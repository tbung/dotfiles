# dotfiles

Dotfiles for my terminal-based workflow.

![terminal nvim](screenshots/terminal_nvim.png)

## The Setup

Neovim in Zsh in Tmux in Ghostty.

I also like using modern alternatives to common command-line tools like `ripgrep`,
`fd-find`, `lsd` and such.

## Install

Just running
```bash
make
```
will create symlinks for everything.
